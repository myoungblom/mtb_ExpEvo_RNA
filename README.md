# mtb_ExpEvo_RNA
Scripts and data for differential expression analyses from publication "Natural variation and adaptive constraints on the biofilm transcriptome of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_"

### DEFiles
Differential expression results for all comparisons and populations

### HTSeqCounts
Raw expression counts from [sequence analysis pipeline](https://github.com/myoungblom/RNAseq)

### Metadata
All metadata associated with samples from this study, including the annotation file used for expression counts.

### Differential expression analyses
Anc BvP - comparison of biofilm to planktonic gene expression in ancestral populations
B EvA - comparison of evolved to ancestral gene expression in biofilm populations
Duplication - analysis of differential expression within large duplication
Evo BvP - comparison of biofilm to planktonic gene expression in evolved populations
P EvA - comparison of evolved to ancestral gene expression in planktonic populations
ncRNA sORF - analysis of differential expression of ncRNAs and sORFs
